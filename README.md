# Airport weather service

This is a a service that can return the weather at an airport, implemented using 
Apache Camel and freely available SOAP web services.

Goals of this project:

- Use web services from different providers
- Be able to test the routes
- Include error handling
- Try various methods for transformation

Notice that webservicex.net is quite unreliable during US working hours, 
probably because of to too many requests.
